# neural_optimizer_search

This program is an implementation to the 2017 ICML paper [Neural Optimizer Search with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07417)

- Implement a controller RNN in tensorflow, update by `policy gradients`. Controller RNN is defined in `Controller.py`
- Implement a small ConvNet target network in Keras, defined in `train_target.py`
- `my_optimizer` convert a string generated by controller RNN into an optimizer compiled in keras model
- `lg3.txt` register your training results over episodes
- `\log` dir contains computaional graph and variable values during training Controller RNN, use tensorboard to check
- It does not support distributed computing.

# Usage

- Adjust hyperparameters in `main.py`
- By default, just execute `main.py`

# Requirements
- python >= 3.5
- Keras >= 1.2.1
- Tensorflow >= 1.4
